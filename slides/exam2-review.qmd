## Announcements

-- Exam 2 on Thursday

- No slack or TA office hours 

- Don't cheat 

- Due Monday at 2

-- All keys are posted (or will be posted before noon tomorrow)


## Grading Questions 

-- EC for Exam 1 is not in 

-- Lowest HW is dropped 

-- Lowest Lab is dropped 


## Study Tips - Variables 

-- Identify variables

- Categorical vs Quantitative 

- Explanatory vs Response 

## Models by Variable Type{.smaller} 

-- Simple Linear Regression: 1 Quantitative Response; 1 Categorical or Quantitative Explanatory Variable 

-- Mulitple Linear Regression: 1 Quantitative Response; 2 or more Categorical or Quantitative Explanatory Variables

-- Logistic Regression: 1 Categorical Response (Binary); 1 or more Categorical or Quantitative Explanatory Variables

## Study Tips - Make your own guide

```{r}
#| eval: false

  summarize(ppg.mean = mean(ppg)) #Summarize is used to calculate a summary statistic 
                                  #arguments: new name = calculated statistic

## Exam Format 

-- Short response questions 

-- Application questions 

-- Extension questions 

## Goals

-- Review 

- Simpson's Paradox 

- P-value interpretation  

-- Compare two means, and do a bootstrap interval

-- Prediction and bootstrap interval for the slope

## Simpson's Paradox{.smaller} 

Describe the relationships observed in the scatter plot. Comment on: Form; Strength; Direction.

## Simpson's Paradox - Same Data... Ungrouped{.smaller}

What about now? 

![](images/simp2.png){width="350" height="400" fig-align="center"}

... a trend appears in groups of data but disappears or reverses when the groups are combined.


## p-values 

-- What is it? 

-- How do we interpret it? 


## p-values 

-- **Probability**

-- of observing **what we did** or something **more extreme** 

-- given $H_O$ = T

## Example 

Airbnb Example 

-- Response variable: price per guest 

-- Assume Ho: $\mu$ = 60

-- p-value ~ 0.14

## Example{.smaller}

![](images/pvalueexample.png)

The **probability** of observing a mean price per guest of **76.6 dollars**, or **something larger**, assuming that the **true mean price per guest of Ashville, NC Airbnbs in June 2020 was 60 dollars** is equal to ~ 0.14.
