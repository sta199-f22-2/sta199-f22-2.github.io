## Checklist

-- Clone `ae-20`

## Announcements

-- HW 5 (Due Thursday)

-- Small typo on HW 5 (see Slack)

-- You may see some hints posted as well....

-- Drop 1 Peer Feedback

## Goals

-- Compare two proportions, and do a hypothesis test

-- Compare two means, and do a bootstrap interval

-- Prediction and bootstrap interval for the slope

## Warm Up: Can we always make inference? 

-- What assumption do we need to make about our data in order to trust results from our bootstrap methods? 

## Assumption - Independence 

-- What is independence? 

- One observation does not effect or influence another 

## Independence Example 

-- 50 Airbnb listings in 2020 for Asheville, NC.

## How do we ensure Independnece  

-- Random Sample - Every observation has an equal probability of being selected 

-- A random sample ensures that our sample is representative of the entire population

## If we don't have a random sample ... 

-- Our results are hard to trust 

-- **Good models and procedures can not fix bad data** 

## For your project 

-- Today, we go through how to bootstrap for a slope coefficient 

-- Can use other bootstrap methods for other questions you may be interested in 

-- Do not use if data are not representitative
